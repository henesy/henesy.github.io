Some kind of blog?

Most software is considered largely unnecessary.

PR||GTFO.

## Generation

The blog index is generated via the [mkindex](./mkindex.rc) [rc](http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/rc) script which sorts based on the most recently modified file.

The rc for unix port I use is by Byron Rakitzis: <https://github.com/rakitzis/rc>
