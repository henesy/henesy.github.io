      <title>Writing UTF-8 Programs in Plan 9</title>

      <description>Writing UTF-8 Programs in Plan 9 This post was written using 9front/amd64 “COMMUNITY VS INFRASTRUCTURE” as a reference.
Programs are built on Plan 9 using the 2c(1) compiler suite.
Thus, on amd64:
tenshi% 6c rsize.c tenshi% 6l rsize.6 tenshi% 6.out わ 4 4 tenshi% Remember, in C, a char (ASCII character) is almost always 1 byte (8 bits).
This document presumes that a non-rune char is 1 byte.
Initial reading  C Programming in Plan 9  UTF-8 in Plan 9 Plan 9 is full of UTF-8 aware programs, which makes sense, given that Plan 9 was the system UTF-8 was designed on/for.</description>

      <description>Creating and Applying 9front Patches (Git Edition) History   October 2018, Ori pushes the first commit to git9.
  April 2019, Ori starts the 9fans thread &#39;[9fans] Git/fs: Possibly Usable&#39;.
  Late April 2019, Lufia announces their port of unix git on 9fans thread &#39;[9fans] Git client&#39;.
  June 2019, git9 migrates to git.
  July 2020, Atlassian deletes all Mercurial repositories without archive or remorse.</description>

      <title>Go&#39;s History in Code</title>

      <description>Go&amp;rsquo;s History in Code This post intends to showcase programming patterns, or stuff, which is common between Newsqueak, Alef, Plan9 C, Limbo, and Go.
All of these code snippets should be complete as shown and compilable/runnable in the state presented. The Alef examples might have subtle typos, but this is due to the fact I had to manually re-type them out from VirtualBox since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have copy/paste available to the guest.</description>

      <title>Porting Unix Software to Plan9</title>

      <description>Porting Unix Software to Plan9 The original source code used in this port: https://github.com/rswier/c4.
The final port source code for the port: https://github.com/henesy/c4.
The commits for the port starting from my history should vaguely reflect the order and rough increment of changes described in this post. It is recommended to skim the source and changes while reading ☺.
Initial reading  C Programming in Plan 9  Porting This post will show the process of porting a unix program, c4, to plan9.</description>

      <title>Using p9sk1 authentication in modern 9front</title>
      <link>https://seh.dev/p9sk1/</link>

      <description>Using p9sk1 authentication in modern 9front Many moons ago 9front moved to dp9ik auth from p9sk1 due to security concerns. However, there may be cases, such as using parts of plan9port, that one may want to enable the old cpu protocol and p9sk1 authentication.
Steps to complete:
 Enable p9sk1 by removing the -N flag from the authsrv(2) init scripts:  /rc/bin/service.auth/authsrv.il566 /rc/bin/service.auth/tcp567   Enable the legacy cpu(1) protocol server via:  mv &#39;/rc/bin/service/!</description>

      <title>Intro to Graphics on Plan 9</title>

      <description>Intro to Graphics on Plan 9 A common question asked all over the Plan 9 community is that of how to get started making GUI applications, as 9 is closely married to the GUI.
While I might get around to a step by step tutorial on GUI programming in another post or location, I&amp;rsquo;d rather compile some helpful examples and resources for getting started.
Some useful programs for reference:
 9pong 9clock lines squares bouncing ball example breakout snake clock catclock glendy mahjongg  Some useful documents for reference:</description>

      <description>Creating and Applying 9front Patches (HG Edition) Creating To create a patch we first pull 9front&amp;rsquo;s hg repo and bind our files into place:
sysupdate bind -a /dist/plan9front / cd / In this example we&amp;rsquo;re making a patch for rio, any combination of folders should work:
bind $home/src/rio /sys/src/cmd/rio To get the latest commit:
hg log | sed 5q A first log output example might be:
changeset: 6705:eecec6d3b341 user: cinap_lenrek@felloff.net date: Mon Sep 03 20:54:26 2018 +0200 summary: vt: fix plumbsel(), snarfsel() The commit hash we&amp;rsquo;re looking for is eecec6d3b341 and we can use it as follows to make the diff file:</description>

      <title>Touring Blit in 2018</title>

      <description>Touring Blit in 2018 Ever wondered if there was a nice way to get a VAX-grade, semi-authentic, Blit experience?
Good news! While 9front ships with a Blit emulator via games/blit you can also connect to UNIX from GNU/Linux with this handy port and plan9port.
To get a connection going just run the following on your emulator of choice:
blit -t &amp;#39;tcp!papnet.eu!8888&amp;#39; Choose ken as your username.
To start a window manager:</description>

      <title>Install Notes for Plan 9 Second Edition</title>

      <description>Install Notes for Plan 9 Second Edition A thanks to aap for providing copies of the floppy images and isos used to perform the test installs. None of this would have been able to happen without you.
Disclaimer: I have not successfully managed to get Plan 9 2e (2e from hereon) installed in qemu or physical hardware. Qemu has had issues due to the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m unfamiliar with configuring IDE in qemu.</description>
