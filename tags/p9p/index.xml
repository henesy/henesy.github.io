      <description>Using Plan9Port Mkfiles Recently I decided to play with the idea of porting Nemo&amp;rsquo;s semfs (from Ch13 of his book) to *nix as a learning exercise.
As a goal I wanted to change as little of the original code as possible. Even with the plan9port 9c/9l bindings however, some portions of the source (unnamed struct members, mostly) did not build and required changing.
A notable point of change was the mkfile for semfs, originally using the mkone file, I needed to find the equivalent mkfile in plan9port.</description>
